To create package.json file you need to use NPM (Node Package Manager).

1. To initialize a package
$: npm init
follow the procedure and o completion you will see a package.json file.

2. To install a package
$: npm install <package name>
in node_modules folder your package will be added & in package.json as dependencies.

3. To uninstall a package
$: npm uninstall <package name>
from node_modules folder your package will be removed & from package.json as dependencies.

4. understanding versioning semantics
eg. lodash: "^4.17.11"
In above example three numbers indicate major no, minor no and patch no. 
The patch is just a fix.
Minor version means new functionality or deprecated but the code will not break;
Major version means the strucure is completely changed. Code will break.

The ^ sign means don't update for minor version and patch no.
The ~ sign means only update for patches.
If you want exact same version then dont put any sign.
